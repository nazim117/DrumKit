# DrumKit

I have completed a web project about a dynamic drum kit, generating sounds in response to specific events. 
The implementation involves a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve an engaging and interactive user experience. 
Feel free to check out the repository for more details and to explore the functionality!
